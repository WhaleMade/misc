@gabehollombe convinced me to write this. let's see how long it takes.

Here's the challenge details:

He did his in coffeescript+canvas (because he hates himself :) 
* code: https://github.com/gabehollombe/unshred/
* demo: http://gabehollombe.github.com/unshred/

It's very cool, but I wanted to try a different algorithm which I was sure would work. My basic idea: use levenshtein distances on columns!

RESULT
===
It worked!

the bonus is easy: to detect width, just run the levenshtein distances to find deltas and count the delta spikes, will do that if i have time/motivation, but my itch is pretty scratched here...

there are a few extra loops that could be tightened, and i'm sure there's a better representation (shifting colorspace?) for doing pixel difference comparisons, but for an abstract exercise...

DEPENDENCIES
===
* easy_install python-Levenshtein
